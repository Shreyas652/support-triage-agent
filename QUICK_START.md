## 🎬 Run The Demo

```powershell
# Activate your environment
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run complete demo (single ticket + batch processing + metrics)
python src/complete_demo.py

# Or run individual components:
python src/agent/triage_agent.py          # Triage 3 tickets
python src/metrics_dashboard.py           # Generate metrics report
```

---

## 📹 Record Your Demo Video (3 Minutes)

Follow the **[DEMO_SCRIPT.md](DEMO_SCRIPT.md)** which includes:

### Timestamps:
- **0:00-0:35** - Show the problem (manual triage pain)
- **0:35-2:00** - Live agent demo (process 2 tickets showing 5-step reasoning)
- **2:00-2:30** - Show metrics comparison (99.1% time savings)
- **2:30-3:00** - Explain architecture (3 tools integration)

### Recording Setup:
1. Use OBS Studio (free)
2. Screen capture + webcam in corner
3. Background music (YouTube Audio Library)
4. Export as 1080p MP4

### What to Show:
```powershell
# Run this during recording to show live agent:
python src/complete_demo.py

# Show these two ticket examples:
# 1. Enterprise customer billing error → CRITICAL priority
# 2. Free user feature request → LOW priority
# This demonstrates context-aware decision making!
```
