# Elasticsearch Agent Builder Hackathon

## 🎯 Quick Overview
Build a custom multi-step AI agent using Elastic Agent Builder and Elasticsearch to automate real-world tasks.

**Prize Pool**: $20,000 | **What to Build**: Multi-step AI agents that combine reasoning, search, workflows, and tools to get work done—not just answer prompts.

## 📅 Key Dates
- **Registration & Submission**: January 22, 2026 (2:00 PM ET) – **February 27, 2026 (1:00 PM ET)**
- **Judging Period**: February 27, 2026 (1:15 PM ET) – March 14, 2026 (9:00 PM ET)
- **Winners Announced**: On or around March 16, 2026 (2:00 PM ET)

⏰ **Days Remaining**: ~22 days until submission deadline (as of Feb 5, 2026)

## 🎁 What to Build

### Project Requirements
Your project MUST include:
1. ✅ **Elastic Agent Builder** - Multi-step agent with reasoning model
2. ✅ **One or more tools**:
   - **Elastic Workflows** - Execute multi-step processes
   - **Search** - Query your Elasticsearch indexes
   - **ES|QL** - Piped query language for logic and analytics
3. ✅ **Private Elasticsearch data** - Real or synthetic data in ES
4. ✅ **Business Task Automation** - Solve a clear, real-world problem

### What Makes a Great Agent?
- 🔄 **Multi-step reasoning**: Not just "search and answer"—analyze, decide, act across multiple steps
- 🎯 **Clear impact**: Measurable time saved, errors reduced, or processes improved
- 🔧 **Tool selection**: Agent chooses the right tool for each step
- 📊 **Real context**: Uses Elasticsearch as the knowledge base
